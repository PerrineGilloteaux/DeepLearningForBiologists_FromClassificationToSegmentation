# DeepLearningForBiologists_FromClassificationToSegmentation
Deep learning has demonstrated astonishing classification and segmentation results in microscopy, outperforming all existing approaches. While many codes are publicly available, they require expertise that most biologists lack. The goal of this workshop is to learn how to train and process deep convolutional neural networks for image classification and image segmentation. More specifically, participants will learn how to install python packages and run Jupyter notebooks, train deep learning classifiers to classify images with or without transfer learning, use the ImageJ plugin Annotater to manually annotate images, train deep learning approaches and use them to segment tissue and nuclei, in 2D and 3D images. This workshop does not require proficiency in any coding language.<br>

This is a 3-day workshop. Slides describing the background required to understand the methods and links to video tutorials are available in Courses. All the codes and data used during the workshop are located in Codes and Data.
